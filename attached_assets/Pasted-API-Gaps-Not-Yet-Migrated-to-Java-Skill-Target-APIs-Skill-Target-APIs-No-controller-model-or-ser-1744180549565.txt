Required New Java Components
To fully migrate the application, you need to implement:

PendingSkillUpdateController with associated models, repositories, and services
Advanced Analytics features in the existing AnalyticsController
Profile History tracking in UserController or a dedicated ProfileHistoryController
User-Project relationship endpoints in either UserController or ProjectController
