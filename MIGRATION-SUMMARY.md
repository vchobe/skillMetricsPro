# Database Migration and Deployment Summary

## Overview

This document summarizes the database migration, schema updates, and Cloud Run deployment configuration implemented for the SkillMetrics application.

## Database Migration

### 1. Schema Updates

The following updates were made to the report_settings table:

| Column Name       | Data Type | Description                                | Status    |
|-------------------|-----------|--------------------------------------------|-----------| 
| base_url          | TEXT      | Customizable base URL for links in reports | Added ✅  |
| description       | TEXT      | Descriptive details about the report       | Added ✅  |
| recipient_email   | TEXT      | Compatible column name (from recipients)   | Added ✅  |
| active            | BOOLEAN   | Compatible column name (from is_active)    | Added ✅  |

### 2. Data Migration

The existing report settings were updated with:

- Default base_url: `https://skillmetrics-production.run-asia-southeast1.goorm.app`
- Default description: "Weekly summary of resources added to projects, sent every Monday at 9:00 AM"
- Data copied from `recipients` column to `recipient_email`
- Data copied from `is_active` column to `active`

### 3. Migration Scripts

The following scripts were created for database migration:

- `update-report-settings-schema.mjs`: Adds new columns to the schema
- `update-report-settings-data.mjs`: Updates existing records with default values
- `apply-report-settings-migration.mjs`: Comprehensive migration script that handles both schema and data
- `check-report-settings.mjs`: Verifies the current report settings table

## Deployment Configuration

### 1. Database Connection

**Direct IP Connection** (Preferred Method):
- Host: 34.30.6.95
- Database: neondb
- User: neondb_owner

**Connection Helper**:
- `cloud-sql-connection-helper.mjs`: Provides flexible connection options

### 2. Deployment Files

The following files were created for Cloud Run deployment:

| Filename                       | Description                                            |
|--------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------|
| Dockerfile.cloud-run-optimized | Optimized Docker configuration for Cloud Run           |
| cloudbuild.direct-db.yaml      | Cloud Build configuration with direct database access  |
| deploy-cloud-run-direct-ip.sh  | Script for manual deployment to Cloud Run             |
| test-cloud-sql-connection.sh   | Script to verify database connectivity                |
| cloud-sql-setup.md             | Documentation on Cloud SQL connection options          |
| CLOUD-RUN-DEPLOYMENT-GUIDE.md  | Comprehensive deployment guide                        |

### 3. Environment Variables

The application is configured to use the following environment variables:

```
DATABASE_URL=postgresql://neondb_owner:npg_6SNPYmkEt5pa@34.30.6.95/neondb
PGHOST=34.30.6.95
PGUSER=neondb_owner
PGPASSWORD=npg_6SNPYmkEt5pa
PGDATABASE=neondb
NODE_ENV=production
```

## Compatibility Layer

The implementation includes a backward compatibility layer to support both old and new column names:

1. Schema level:
   - Both `recipients` and `recipient_email` columns are maintained
   - Both `is_active` and `active` columns are maintained

2. Application level:
   - The database queries and storage layer accept both naming conventions
   - Data is synchronized between the old and new column names

## Verification Steps

The changes have been verified with:

1. Direct database connection test using:
   ```bash
   node test-cloud-sql-direct.mjs
   ```

2. Schema verification using:
   ```bash
   node check-report-settings.mjs
   ```

3. Migration testing using:
   ```bash
   node apply-report-settings-migration.mjs
   ```

## Next Steps

1. Run the final migration script on production: `node apply-report-settings-migration.mjs`
2. Update the application code to use the new column names
3. Deploy to Cloud Run using the provided scripts
4. Verify the deployment using the Cloud Run URL
5. Monitor for any issues with database connectivity or report generation
